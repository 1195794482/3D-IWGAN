# Improved Adversarial Systems for 3D Object Generation and Reconstruction:
This is a repository for the paper "Improved Adversarial Systems for 3D Object Generation and Reconstruction". 
There are three GAN projects held here. The first, held in the folder 3D-Generation, is code for generating 
3D objects. The second, held in the folder 3D-Translation, is code for producing 3D objects when 
conditioned on image inputs. The third, held in the folder 3D-reconstruction, is code for reconstructing 
3D objects, from single perspective depth scans.
